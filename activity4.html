            <h2>Beginning</h2>
            <p>Kevin was bored. Dangerously bored. “School needs more spice,” he muttered, staring at the dull beige walls of 7B
            homeroom. He doodled a squirrel on a jet ski and passed it to Tasha. She nodded solemnly. “Operation Pandemonium?”
            
            “Operation Pandemonium.”
            
            And just like that, chaos was born—with glue sticks, glitter, Alfredo the llama, and a very wobbly plan scribbled on a napkin.</p>

<h2>Middle</h2>
<p>It all started when Kevin bet Tasha that she couldn’t sneak a llama onto school grounds without anyone noticing. She
did. Its name was Alfredo. Alfredo was surprisingly cooperative, except when startled by saxophone solos or cafeteria
fish sticks.

Meanwhile, Jenny hacked the school’s intercom so that every time someone said the word "exam," it blasted a foghorn
sound. This caused mass panic during Chemistry. One teacher fainted.

And let’s not even talk about the spontaneous hallway flash mob to the tune of “Banana Phone.”

    <h2>End</h2>
    <p>Principal Bumble marched into the school auditorium holding a large rubber chicken and a glitter cannon, shouting, “This
    ends now!” The entire student body was laughing uncontrollably. The statue of the school mascot, once noble and
    dignified, now wore a tutu and had googly eyes glued to its face. Kevin was suspended (again), the fire alarm had gone
    off (again), and no one could prove who replaced the morning announcements with a dramatic reading of "The Chicken
    Whisperer."
    
    It was beautiful chaos.
